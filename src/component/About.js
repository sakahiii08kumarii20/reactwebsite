        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Vijay Sonigara, a professional photographer with over 20 years of experience in capturing life's precious moments. My journey began when I picked up my first camera at the age of 15, and since then, I have been passionate about creating beautiful and meaningful photographs.</p>
        <p>Photography is not just my profession, but also my way of expressing art and emotions. I specialize in wedding, Birthday, Candid, and Traditional photography. My goal is to create timeless images that tell stories and evoke emotions.</p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>I believe in capturing genuine moments and natural expressions. My approach is to blend in with the background and let the moments unfold organically. This allows me to capture the true essence of the event and the people involved.</p>
        <p>I use the latest equipment and techniques to ensure the highest quality of images. I am constantly learning and evolving to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and styles in photography.</p>
